Here are the notebooks I made in order to study the overlap between PM2.5 and heat days in  CAlifornia.

SampleCompundDaysProj:

Here is the code to sift through the EPA data and make a plot of PM 2.5 and temperature over time for all the available years. The original has plotted every single sensor that I could find, but its too big to upload to GitHub, so I made a "sample" version that simply plots the first couple of sensors I worked on. TO plot additional sensors, simply use the same code on the different data files provided.

TheMap:

Contains the code to plot a scatterplot over the map of California and get a visual representaiton of what we're looking for. NOTE: This code is dependent on an Excel spreadsheet I filled out by hand. In the future it is probably best to get the computer to calcul;ate all of this data, but I was too tired to figure out the best way of doung this, so I just wrote everything by hand. For now, just make sure the EXCEL sheet is working if you would like to plot things for yourself.
