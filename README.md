# Mapping Extreme Temperature and PM2.5 Concentration Coextremes Across California
It is well known in the scientific community that exposure to either extreme heat or extreme concetrations of pollutants (such as PM 2.5) can pose severe health risks. However, new evidence is emerging that may suggest that the simultanous expoisure of both these conditions may create a synergestic effect where the harmful effects of both can be augmented. This notebook attempts to map the number of these compound days across the state of California, to see how the prevalence of these harmful conditions have changed over time.

# Methodology
The U.S. EPA Air Quality Database was used to map out the distribution of both extreme heat and PM2.5 conditions. 

# Results
A variety of the maps were created such as the one below. 

An important note is that while the number of compound days on average increases as time goes on, it is likely due to the fact that more sensors were made avaiable in recent years, so it is not safe to conclude that there is an increase in compound days from the data alone.
